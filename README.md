This project focuses on analyzing the impact of climate policy uncertainty on corporate greenwashing behavior, 
specifically in the context of Chinese companies. The aim is to quantify companies' responsiveness to climate policies. 
We utilized BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art deep learning model for natural language processing,
to perform sentiment analysis on large-scale corporate textual data in Chinese. 
By extracting positive and environmentally conscious statements from annual reports and other documents, 
we measured the ratio of positive sentences over total sentences for each company and year.
The results provide valuable insights into the trends and motivations behind corporate greenwashing among Chinese companies.
